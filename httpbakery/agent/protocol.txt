PROTOCOL V1

The v1 agent protocol is initiated by the client once a discharge has
failed with an interaction required error.

An agent login works as follows:

	    Agent                            Login Service
	      |                                    |
	      | GET visitURL with agent cookie     |
	      |----------------------------------->|
	      |                                    |
	      |    Macaroon with local third-party |
	      |                             caveat |
	      |<-----------------------------------|
	      |                                    |
	      | GET visitURL with agent cookie &   |
	      | discharged macaroon                |
	      |----------------------------------->|
	      |                                    |
	      |               Agent login response |
	      |<-----------------------------------|
	      |                                    |

The agent cookie is a cookie named "agent-login" holding a base64
encoded JSON object with the following structure.

{
	"username": <username>,
	"public_key": <public_key>
}

The username parameter is a string containing the username of the user
performing the login. The public_key parameter is the base64 encoded
public key of the user.

A local third-party caveat is a third party caveat with the location
set to "local" and the caveat encrypted with the public key declared
in the agent cookie. The httpbakery.Client automatically discharges
the local third-party caveat.

On success the response is the following JSON object:

{
	"agent_login": "true" 
}

If an error occurs then the response should be a JSON object that
unmarshals to an httpbakery.Error.


PROTOCOL V2

The v2 agent protocol is initiated when attempting to perform a
discharge. It works as follows:

	    Agent                            Login Service
	      |                                    |
	      | POST discharge with agent cookie   |
	      |----------------------------------->|
	      |                                    |
	      |         Interaction Required Error |
          |     containing macaroon with local |
          |                 third-party caveat |
	      |<-----------------------------------|
	      |                                    |

If the discharge request is accompanied by an "agent-login" cookie
of the form identical to that used in the v1 protocol, then the
interaction required response will include an "agent" interaction method.
The parameters for this interaction method will be a JSON object like
the following:

{
	"macaroon": <macaroon>
}

Where macaroon contains the discharge macaroon for the original
discharge. This macaroon will have a "local" third-party caveat on it
using the public key specified in the agent-login cookie. Interaction
is completed by the client discharging that macaroon locally.
